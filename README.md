# AppSignal Demo

In this video we cover how to add error and performance tracking to Next.js wit AppSignal. We'll do this by adding a custom server to support server-side performance tracking. We will also add Apollo Server tracking and Web Vital tracking. Then we will add Error reporting to the frontend in our React code, and finally deploy this project to Heroku.
